Description: An R 'Shiny' application to access the functionalities and datasets of the 'archeofrag' package for spatial analysis in archaeology from refitting data. Quick and seamless exploration of archaeological refitting datasets, focusing on connection relationships only (i.e. physical refits). Features include: built-in documentation and convenient workflow, plot generation and export, R code generation to re-execute the simulations in R and ensure reproducibility, support for parallel computing to speed up computation. A demonstration version of the app is available at <https://analytics.huma-num.fr/Sebastien.Plutniak/archeofrag/>.
